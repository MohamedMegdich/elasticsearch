Search DSL
The Search object
The Search object represents the entire search request:

queries
filters
aggregations
sort
pagination
additional parameters
associated client
The API is designed to be chainable. With the exception of the aggregations functionality this means that the Search object is immutable - all changes to the object will result in a shallow copy being created which contains the changes. This means you can safely pass the Search object to foreign code without fear of it modifying your objects as long as it sticks to the Search object APIs.
